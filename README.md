# Hi, I'm Rishav 👋

> 📌 **Note:** This is my new GitHub profile. For my previous work and contributions, please visit my other GitHub ID: [@rishav21556](https://github.com/rishav21556)

**Full Stack Engineer who likes building systems that solve real operational problems.**

I don't just build apps.
I build **production systems**, **algorithms**, and **tools that make real work easier**.

* Worked on an **autonomous robotic inventory system** used in live warehouse operations
* Designed **task scheduling & assignment algorithms** to optimize robot utilization
* Built **scalable REST/Webhook services** powering real business workflows
* Obsessed with turning messy real-world problems into clean technical solutions

## 🚀 Tech I work with

**Frontend**
Next.js • React.js • Tailwind

**Backend**
NestJS • Node.js • FastAPI • Spring Boot • Express

**Database**
Postgres • MySQL • MongoDB • Redis

**Tools & Platforms**
Git • GitHub • Vercel • Render • Selenium

## 🧠 What I enjoy building

* Systems that interact with the real world (operations, logistics, automation)
* Clean backend architectures & APIs
* Features that remove manual work for people
* Products that feel simple but hide complex engineering inside

---

## 🏗️ Experience highlight

### Software Engineer — Lumio Partners

Built the backend and core logic for a **robotic autonomous inventory system**:

* Priority-based robotic picking & delivery
* Task scheduling algorithms to reduce idle time
* REST/Webhook APIs for internal tools and integrations
* Automation tools that reduced operational overhead
* Worked directly with ops teams to translate real constraints into engineering solutions

## ♟️ Projects I'm proud of

### WebPy — Current Project 🔥

A developer tool that **instantly transforms CLI Python scripts into interactive web applications**:

* Zero configuration - just run your script
* Automatic form generation from `input()` calls  
* Beautiful split-screen interface (input/output)
* Perfect for sharing demos, teaching Python, or rapid prototyping
* Built with Flask, focused on developer experience and ease of use

**Tech:** Python • Flask • Flask-Session • Waitress

---

### Chess Application

A full-feature chess platform focused on:

* Game logic accuracy
* Real-time interactions
* Clean UI and smooth experience

---

## 🎯 Currently

* Building and refining **WebPy** - making Python scripts accessible to everyone
* Grinding LeetCode to sharpen problem solving
* Exploring better system design patterns
* Building side projects that solve practical problems
